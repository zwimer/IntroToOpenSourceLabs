1. What I changed: In the FreeBSD Arch handbook, in chapter 1.6, line 1331, the word accessible was misspelled, I corrected that.

2. It is important to maintain good documentation so that other programmers may used what you wrote with ease. The better the documentation, the easier it will be for others to use it. Furthermore, it is good to maintain proper spelling in case someone who barely speaks your language reads your documentation, and needs to use a translator or something akin to that. But the better your documentation, the more support you will have for your project.

3. From this lab I have learned just how many people work on maintaining documentation for FreeBSD, and just how I can contribute to this community.
