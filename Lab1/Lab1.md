c. Reading assignments: 
  2. Two ways to ask better questions: 
    - After researching a question I want answered, if I cannot answer it myself after a good amount of research and attempts, I will post to stack overflow. When I do however, I do not simply post my question. The majority of my post is me explaining what I attempted, what the results were, and what I have found shows promise. 
    - Another method of asking better questions is being specific. Instead of asking 'how can I fix my computer?' ask something akin to 'Corrupted file: A file in the format X has been corrupted, likely due to Y. I am running the operating system Z, version W. I have no backups, and was wondering if it was possible to recover any of the information from this corrupted file.' 
  3. Free culture.
    - I find this story rather horrible. What they are doing is extorting money out of blameless people because they know they won't be able to fight back. And the fact they can do so with such ease is a testament to how broken out legal system can become due to lobbyists. I was actually curious enough that I read more of the book, and found the example given with the 12 year old girl having her life savings just as atrocious. I would say that this were not as, keyword as, horrible if any of the following occurred: First, if he modified the program with the intent of finding music files on other's computers. Second, if he wrote the entire program by himself. Third, if he made a profit from it. And finally, if he did anything other than simply patch a bug in a pre-existing, already owned program, for fun!

g. A student in RPI can login to sis.rpi.edu, and easily get their CAPP report normally; double majors receive one for each major. Dual majors however only receive the CAPP report for their primary major. This means to know what they have to take to graduate they have to go through their requirements, for whichever year's they wish, and painstakingly cross out courses on each schedule, and hope they didn't make a mistake. As a dual major myself, I know just how easy it is to make a mistake, to misunderstand a rule, or to count certain courses in a less efficient manner than possible yielding a result which says I need to take more courses than I really do to graduate. I would like to write a simple python program which, with your explicit permission, logs into sis.rpi.edu, checks which courses you have taken, which AP credits you have transferred in, and which courses you are taking right now. It will then do exactly what the double major CAPP report program will do except it will not require the additional 30 credits.
