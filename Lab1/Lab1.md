Two ways to ask better questions: 
  1. After researching a question I want answered, if I cannot answer it myself after a good amount of research and attempts, I will post to stack overflow. When I do however, I do not simply post my question. The majority of my post is me explaining what I attempted, what the results were, and what I have found shows promise. 
  2. Another method of asking better questions is being specific. Instead of asking 'how can I fix my computer?' ask something akin to 'Corrupted file: A file in the format X has been corrupted, likely due to Y. I am running the operating system Z, version W. I have no backups, and was wondering if it was possible to recover any of the information from this corrupted file.'
