4. I agree with the claim, so long as we emphasize the words 'tends to'. While I do believe that in many cases, 'worse is better', I am absolutely sure that in some circumstances 'the right thing' is better. That being said however, I believe that a developer should release the 'worse' copy first, but instead of just stopping there, should pursue 'the right thing' while taking input from the community which their code was released into. This allows the developer to get early feedback and information while still allowing them not only to pursue their 'right thing' goal, but to improve it via the feedback of their software's users.

5. I think justification for the MIT liscence is easiest. First off, it is an open source liscence, and thus allows others to freely modify, copy, and distrubte the code (and much more). Second of all, I believe this lisense is such that it frees the origional creator of the software from liability of it's use and of the liability of the software made via it. For example, if I were to write a software that simply collects publiclly available files and makes them easier to access (such as music files on the public folder of a computer), I wouldn't be liable if someone used that software to pirate millions of dollars worth of music and video. This I believe is very important, and I believe for something as this is essential. In other words, microsoft won't be held accountable for criminals using hteir software for cyber crimes.
