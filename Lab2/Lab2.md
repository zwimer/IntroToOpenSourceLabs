3. You shouldn't use unlicensed code for legal reasons. The code, if not explicitly licensed, is all rights reserved. As such, is is technically illegal to "reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from [thier code]." Even if the code was clearly meant to be freely shared, it is illegal. Furthermore, this code is simply illegal for you to use. Many times you may simply be able to ask whoever owns the code to add a license, but if for some reason you cannot contact them and use the code anyway, you will be liable for damages. 

4. I agree with the claim, so long as we emphasize the words 'tends to'. While I do believe that in many cases, 'worse is better', I am absolutely sure that in some circumstances 'the right thing' is better. That being said however, I believe that a developer should release the 'worse' copy first, but instead of just stopping there, should pursue 'the right thing' while taking input from the community which their code was released into. This allows the developer to get early feedback and information while still allowing them not only to pursue their 'right thing' goal, but to improve it via the feedback of their software's users.

5. I think justification for the MIT liscence is easiest. First off, it is an open source liscence, and thus allows others to freely modify, copy, and distrubte the code (and much more). Second of all, I believe this lisense is such that it frees the origional creator of the software from liability of it's use and of the liability of the software made via it. For example, if I were to write a software that simply collects publiclly available files and makes them easier to access (such as music files on the public folder of a computer), I wouldn't be liable if someone used that software to pirate millions of dollars worth of music and video. This I believe is very important, and I believe for something as this is essential. In other words, microsoft won't be held accountable for criminals using hteir software for cyber crimes.

6. We have decided to write a program which simply acts as a Capp reporter for dual majors at RPI, since unlike with single and double majors, we have none that report for both of our majors.

9. I think I want to use the MIT liscense for a few reasons. THe biggest reason is the release from liability. While ideally this program would work perfectly everytime, I don not belive it will. For example it may not return the most efficient way of taking all the credits needed, and it may not be accurate if it pulls its information from an outdated source. I will likely have the program display a message warning about this beforehand, but in case someone happens to assume it is perfect and use it, and is unable to graduate in time because they scheduled their classes based on the faulty output, I would not liek to be held responsible. Another reason is simple: I will leave RPI soon and as such won't be super motivated to keep it up to date, and improve it. As such, allowing others to freely modify and distribute it will allow the software to be kept up to date by motivated students, such as those in RCOS.
