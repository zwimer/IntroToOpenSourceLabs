	Our project is coming along. We have successfully designed the GUI, interface, and how each component will intergrate with each other. We have detailed this and created 'languages' (formats for text files) out programs will communicate in to become one program. Unfortunatly one of our members has been absent for a while so we may still be behind... We have a partly function GUI (ahead of schedule) and plans drawn up for a '2.0' version of the GUI. The first one was made for basic functionality not for ease of use necessarily or for asthetics. It is not ugly and is functional but could definatly be improved, specifics have been noted and put in a file (these won't be implemented until we actually get the program working first). We also broke up and each have our own tasks. I design the GUI. Ethan the algo. TJ parses the information. Finally we devised a method to make out project easily extensible and 'upgradable'.
